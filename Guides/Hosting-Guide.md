Hosting Guide
================

This can help hosts of the book club events - especially useful if you
rotate hosts, have multiple locations or online meetings. 

Hosts should also adhere to the [Facilitator Guide](Guides/Facilitator-Guide.md).

### Opening the Event

  - Welcome everyone to the session
  - Intro to the reading group, cross-government data science community, and why we are interested in ethics
  - Welcome from the hosts
  - Reminder of the topic and materials
  - Reminder of others: DataKind UK (and any upcoming events)
  - Tell community this is a safe space:
      - to explore ideas and opinions.
      - Everyone should listen actively with a **generous and open
        mind**
      - do not interrupt or criticise others,
      - consciously aim to help everyone to speak for roughly equal time
      - If anyone feels uncomfortable at any time do speak with
        \[**Hillary**\]
        ### Part 2: Introduction
  - Let everyone know the discussion is under [Chatham house
    rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule)
      - Chatham House
        [rules](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule)
  - Signpost people to the relevant group
  - Point out the facilitators
  - Ask people to put thoughts on Twitter \[**govethicsbookclub**\] but
    paraphrase what people say if needed, as it is Chatham House
  - There'll be a break in the middle of the discussion.

### Introduce Lightning Talk Speakers

  - Provide a short introduction to each speaker: who they are, and what they will be talking about
  - Act as a time-keeper for talks

    club around the questions discussed
  - Let everyone know about the next book club
