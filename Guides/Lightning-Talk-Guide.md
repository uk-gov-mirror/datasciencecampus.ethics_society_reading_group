Facilitator Guide
================

This can be given to facilitators in advance of the book club as a
general help to set expectations etc. We also have specific facilitator
prompts for each topic.

### Part 1: Welcoming (for in-person events)

  - Have one or two people at the entrance to welcome people in
  - Ask people to write out a name label, if they so wish. Include
    pronouns (if you feel comfortable with this)
  - Let them know when we'll be starting (e.g. 630pm doors for 6:45pm
    start)

### Part 2: Group Discussion

  - Groups should be 5-9 people with one facilitator.
  - Remind the group of the schedule for the evening: discussion time should have a 5 minute
    coffee/ loo break halfway through, before regrouping 5 minutes before the
    end.
  - Ask people to introduce themselves - perhaps you could ask everyone
    to say their names, and one word they would use to sum up the
    book/article they read or the topic
  - Introduce the book and articles - who read what? (could be a show of
    hands) - this will give you an idea of what to focus on (e.g. if no
    one read an article, don't focus on that one)
  - Warm up by reading over the pre-set questions to get people thinking
  - Encourage someone to start with sharing something they found
    interesting, e.g. an idea, opinion or a quote they liked or didn't
    like
  - Once people have given their opinions on what was
    interesting/surprising, move onto the discussion points. Ask people
    to give their opinions on the topic and how this is reflected/dealt
    with in the book/article
  - **It's your role to make sure that no one person is dominating the
    conversation**
    
### Part 3: Wrap-Up

  - Summarise some of the most important and/or interesting points which
    were discussed
  - Check out? If you wanted to, you could do a quick check out and ask
    people to sum up in one sentence what they are taking away from the
    discussion
  - Signpost people to regroup in the main event

# House Rules

### Chatham house rule

  - Participants are free to use the information received, but neither
    the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any
    other participant, may be revealed
  - Use social media to take the discussion online - but please don't
    use people's twitter handles (unless they say otherwise)

### Create an inclusive space

  - Try and hear from as many people as possible, without letting one
    person dominate the conversation
  - Make sure to encourage everyone to speak, but don't single people
    out if they are uncomfortable. If people are shy about contributing,
    you could ask them ‘do you agree with that last point?’ rather than
    ‘tell me what you think about the book’, which is a broad and
    potentially intimidating question\!
  - Do not criticise any viewpoints - ask more about why they hold that
    viewpoint, and perhaps say ‘personally I see it more like this’ but
    without saying they are wrong. Discourage others from being critical
    or dismissive of others' opinions
  - Try to smooth over any potential conflict but acknowledging that
    opinions differ and that there is not a wrong or a right answer in
    these discussions

### Guide the conversation

  - Refer to the list of discussion points to help steer the
    conversation, but be flexible
  - Sometimes people won't have much to say about points you thought
    were interesting, while other topics garner a lot of interest and
    discussion - use the discussion points as a guide but be prepared to
    ad-lib and dig into new ideas which people want to talk about
  - Try and avoid getting into very specific examples or random
    anecdotes, which the speaker may find fascinating but which won't
    resonate for many people, or which don't relate to the topic as a
    whole. If people start to go down a rabbit hole, don't be afraid to
    get them back on topic - try a gentle ‘that's an interesting point,
    which we can talk about if we have some more time later, but I'm
    really interested to know what everyone thought about X’

### Be prepared

  - Have some questions ready. Both the general, and the specific. Some
    faciliator questions will be created and shared ahead of the event (see
    [here](../topics_and_materials/Session-1-Facilitator-Qs.md) for an example)
  - Make sure you know how to enter back into the main event
  - Keep an eye on the time
